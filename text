This daily, scaffolded approach to paragraph writing is perfect to help get your students writing good, solid, detailed paragraphs. Students will write one paragraph weekly, focusing on the organization and format of the paragraph itself.

There are 36 weeks worth of writing prompts in this 300+ page file. All of the prompts are student-centered so that they will not get bogged down on the topic but rather focus on writing the paragraph itself. The first 18 weeks are heavily scaffolded, resulting in a nice, solid paragraph. The second 18 weeks switch focus to revising and editing, since the students are now more proficient at writing the actual paragraph.

There are samples of completed paragraphs, a rubric (in two sizes for you to choose), a revising checklist, and even final draft paper for you to use. There are also blank templates for you to create your own writing prompts to better suit the needs of your students.

This is designed as homework (that is how I use it in my room) however you can also use it as classwork in a center or writing warm up. 

This is for use by one teacher in one classroom. If you would like to share with your colleagues, PLEASE purchase a multiple license. This really was a lot of work for me and I would appreciate it.

Would you like to try a sample before you purchase the entire thing? You can click here for a free sample OR you can download the preview....actually, they are two different samples....so do both! Try it out, and see if it works in your classroom, then come back and purchase!
